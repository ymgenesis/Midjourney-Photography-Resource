# Tips & Tricks

- Photorealism is a painting style. Photographers wouldn't label their own photographs as photorealistic. If you want something resembling a photograph, consider just specifying a camera body, film stock, or simply `photograph` or `35mm photograph`.
- 35mm focal length generally produces the best focal length results
- weight film stock to lessen over-saturation (see [weights & phrasing](/weightsnphrasing/weightsnphrasing.md) for examples).
- Language like `wide shot`, `portrait`, or `zoomed in` can often achieve similar or better results than using focal lengths
- Wider focal lengths often result in a ‘fish-eye’ effect, and a larger amount of the image in focus. Narrower focal lengths usually result in heavy depth of field and bokeh/blur.
- Using focal lengths and similar language can change the composition of your image (subject-centric for longer lengths, environment-centric for wider lengths).
- Generally an ISO of 50-200 (ex: Cinestill 50) should produce less grainy images than say 200 and up. Grain is usually the same intensity (unless weighted) once you hit 200 and up.
- Adding the company name ‘Fuji’ sometimes puts mount Fuji in the image
- Be sure to use film stocks, focal lengths, and other terms alongside other prompt language; these terms augment your prompts.
- Pick the correct aspect ratio for your image (2:3/vertical rectangle good for portraits, 3:2/horizontal rectangle good for landscapes)
- B&W film stocks often produce the most cohesive/realistic results
- Any words you use in your prompt influence your image. For example, `...zoom zoom, 14mm...`. Even though you might be trying to describe a fast car, MJ might take `zoom` to mean a long focal length, effectively cancelling out your `14mm` instruction. 
- Couple various camera bodies and film stocks for more variation when specifying a camera body. For example, `marble greek bust, Mamiya RZ67, Fomapan 400 —ar 3:2 —sameseed 1 —uplight`:<br>![doescomputers_marble_greek_bust_Mamiya_RZ67_Fomapan_400_884b328a-6e59-416e-9c9c-0912bec00f22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25252829/181086977-1ecb3442-c6a8-4cf9-a20d-2972f90de243.png)
