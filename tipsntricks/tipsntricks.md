# Tipcs & Tricks

- 35mm focal length generally produces the best focal length results
- weight film stock to lessen over-saturation (…[Kodak Gold 200]::0.50… etc)
- Language like `wide shot`, `portrait`, or `zoomed in` can often achieve similar or better results than using focal lengths
- Wider focal lengths often result in a ‘fish-eye’ effect, and a larger amount of the image in focus. Narrower focal lengths usually result in heavy depth of field and bokeh/blur.
- Using focal lengths and similar language can change the composition of your image (subject-centric for longer lengths, environment-centric for wider lengths).
- Generally an ISO of 50-200 (ex: Cinestill 50) should produce less grainy images than say 200 and up. Grain is usually the same intensity (unless weighted) once you hit 200 and up.
- Adding the company name ‘Fuji’ sometimes puts mount Fuji in the image
- Be sure to use film stocks, focal lengths, apertures, and shutter speeds alongside other prompt language; these terms augment your prompts.
