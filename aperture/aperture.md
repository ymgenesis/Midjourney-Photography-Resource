# Aperture

Aperture values likes `f1.4`, `f2.8`, etc. tend to not have much of an influence on depth of field, but small differences can be observed. This is likely due to the source material not having a clear and consistent set of aperture examples across subject matter. Your mileage may vary, and hopefully this will get better in the future.
