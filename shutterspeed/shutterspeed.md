# Shutter Speed

In general, Midjourney doesn't handle shutter speeds well. Mention of the word `shutter` or `shutter speed` seems to ccause motion blur, no matter the specified shutter speed. Seeing as fractions (ex: `1/1000`) are a common mathematical format, it's fair to assume MJ can't distinguish between shutter speeds and regular integer expressions. Using `s` or `second` also doesn't produce desired results. This is likely due to the source material not having a clear and consistent set of shutter speed examples across subject matter. Your mileage may vary, and hopefully this will get better in the future.
